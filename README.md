Dear Professor,

I would just like to thank you for all your lessons. I have never liked doing coding and I still do not, however you made everything clear and easy to follow. I was stressed when I learned that this course was going to need javascript (my older sibling told me about the pain of it as she does coding) however you made it so easy to understand. 

Thank you for teaching me, 

Aiden Blancher
